Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.
The ones who see things differently. I’re not fond of rules. And I have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.
About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because I change things. I invent. I imagine. I heal. I explore. I create. I inspire. I push the human race forward.
Maybe I have to be crazy.
How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?
I make tools for these kinds of people.
While some see them as the crazy ones, I see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think I can change the world, are the ones who do.
